# MLA-CamemBERT

**MLA-CamemBERT** is a project aimed at reproducing and adapting the **CamemBERT** model, a French-optimized version of RoBERTa.

---

## üìö **Description**

This project provides a complete pipeline to:
- Load and preprocess French-language datasets.
- Adapt a multilingual model to the French language.
- Fine-tune the model on various NLP tasks, including:
  - **POS Tagging (Part-of-Speech Tagging)**
  - **Dependency Parsing**
  - **Natural Language Inference (NLI)**
  - **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

The model is designed to be efficient to train and easily integratable into NLP applications.
